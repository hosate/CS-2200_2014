Problem 1B
----------

1 CPU: 67.6s
2 CPUS: 35.9s
4 CPUS: 33.1s
By increasing the number of CPUs, the total execution time did not decrease linearly.
It decreased exponentially.
Because the simulated computer do not need to run more than two threads. 

With 2 CPUs, most of time is spending on waiting for a thread.  
The extra CPUs would be used more efficiently with more processes running or more multithreaded programs running.

Problem 2B
----------

800 ms
Switches: 136
time: 67.6 s
time in READY state: 228.2 s

600 ms
Switches: 161
time: 67.6 s
time in READY state: 182.0 s

400 ms
Switches: 203
time: 67.6
time in READY state: 134.5 s

200 ms
Switches: 362
time: 67.5 s
time in READY state: 71.2 s


Waiting time has decreased linearly as the length of the time slice decreased.
The execution time same, but switches number increased. 
This is not always good because the processor will incur many more cache misses as it gains affinity for a new process. 

Problem 3B
----------

os-sim 1
Switches: 88
time: 67.6 s
time in READY state: 389.9 s

os-sim 1 -r 4
Switches: 203
time: 67.6 s
time in READY state: 134.5 s

os-sim 1 -p
Switches: 148
time: 67.8 s
time in READY state: 195.7 s

Round-Robin is closest approximation of SJF. It is actually similar to SJF as it will finish the shortest process first.
