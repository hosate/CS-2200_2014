Application Layer - Responsible for supporting network-based applications. A variety of protocols employed.
The protocols provide a common language for application level entities to communicate with each other.

Transport Layer - Responsible for taking an application layer message and ferrying it between the ends of communication. 

Network Layer - On the sending side, finds a way to get the packet to the intended destination address. 
On the receiving end, passes the packet to the transport layer. 

Link Layer - Ferrying the IP packets between nodes on the Internet through which a packet has to be routed from source to destination.

Physical Layer - Responsible for physically moving the bits of the packet from one node to the next. 

=========
2A.

2048/256 = 8 packets
8 * (256 + 32) = 2304 bytes

2B.

20000 / (20 * 10^7) = 0.0001s or 0.1ms
Time of flight = 50ms
Delay = 300us + 300us = 600us or 0.6ms

Time = 0.1 + 50 + 0.6 = 50.7ms

Throughput = 20000/0.0507 = 394,477 bits/s

=========
3A.

TCP and UDP.
TCP is stream or connection oriented, supports windowing and ACK. UDP is message or datagram oriented, does not support aCK or windowing.
UDP when packet loss is tolerable, such as video over internet.
TCP when packet loss is intolerable, such as instant messaging.

3B.

When the sender sends a packet, it waits for positive acknowledgement (ACK). Recipient sends ACK for each packet containing sequence number.
Sender waits until timeout, if no ACK until timeout, it will re-transmit the packet.

The sequence number is necessary as it is the unique signature for each packet and the sender will then be able to acknowledge which packet reached.

=========
4A.

It is an address for each device that is on the network and its location (how to get there).

4B.

Circuit switching requires a dedicated point to point connection, while packet switching move data in small packets based on destination and reassemble upon arrival in the right sequence.
The number of connection is too much for circuit switching.

=========
5A.

The ethernet protocol is CSMA/CD.
It ensures that there are no other machines using the network before sending a message. If there is a collision, it waits for a random period of time before resending the message.

5B.
CSMA/CD - When collision occur, both devices stop transmission and waits for a random period of time before retrying.
CSMA/CA - Signal intent to transmit before doing so.

It helps to avoid the hidden terminal problem.

5C.
RTS - Request to Send
CTS - Clear to Send
RTS/CTS minimize the chance of collision.
